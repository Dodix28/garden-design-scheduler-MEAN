\# Description

This project is a full-stack garden interior design application that allows users to schedule garden services and explore custom garden layouts. Users can import JSON-based layouts, which are then rendered visually, helping them plan and visualize their garden designs. Companies can list their services, and the system includes an admin panel for managing users, companies, and service offerings. This application streamlines garden planning, improves client-company communication, and provides a user-friendly platform for both clients and service providers.
